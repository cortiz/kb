# kb

A personal, serverless knowledge base for reusable operational snippets: SQL, Sumo Logic and
CloudWatch queries, shell commands, prompts, links and code locations. Each snippet is a plain
Markdown file you can edit by hand, and `kb` is a single terminal binary that checks and searches
them.

> Status: milestone M2 (entry format, `kb lint`, `kb search`). The TUI, variables at use time and
> actions arrive in later milestones.

## Building

```sh
cargo build --release      # the binary is target/release/kb
```

## Getting started

```sh
kb init                 # create ~/kb (or the configured root) with one example per type
kb init ~/notes/kb      # or somewhere else
kb init --no-examples   # just the layout
kb lint                 # check every entry
```

`kb init` creates the KB root, a `.kb/` directory for kb's own data, and `.kb/.gitignore`
(containing `*`) so git never picks that data up. It writes nothing else to the root. On a KB
that already exists it only adds what is missing and never changes or overwrites a file, and it
adds example entries only to a KB that has none yet. Copy an example to start a new entry, then
run `kb lint` to check it.

```text
~/kb
├── .kb/
│   └── .gitignore
├── sql/example-active-connections.md
├── sumo/example-5xx-by-authorizer.md
└── …
```

Folders are a convention, not a rule: an entry's type comes from its `type:` field.

## The KB root

Entries live under one directory, the **KB root**. kb looks for it in this order:

1. `--root <path>`
2. the `KB_ROOT` environment variable
3. `root:` in the config file: `~/.config/kb/config.yml` on Linux (or under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`),
   `~/Library/Application Support/kb/config.yml` on macOS
4. `~/kb`

```yaml
# config.yml
root: ~/notes/kb
```

## Entry format

An entry is one UTF-8 Markdown file ending in `.md`, anywhere under the KB root. Its **ID** is its
path without `.md`: `sumo/5xx-by-authorizer.md` is `sumo/5xx-by-authorizer`. Files and folders
whose names start with `.` are ignored, and so is everything that isn't `.md`.

````markdown

A spike in TOKEN_EXPIRED usually means the role cache TTL drifted.

The file starts with YAML frontmatter between `---` lines, followed by a Markdown body.

### Frontmatter

| Key | Required | Value |
|-----|----------|-------|
| `kb_format` | yes | `1` |
| `type` | yes | `sql`, `sumo`, `cw`, `cmd`, `prompt`, `link` or `code` |
| `title` | yes | Text, at most 120 characters |
| `tags` | no | A list; read in lowercase, without a leading `#` |
| `vars` | no | Variable definitions (below) |
| `created`, `updated` | no | `2026-10-08` or `2026-10-08T14:30:00Z` |

Type-specific keys:

| Type | Keys | Payload |
|------|------|---------|
| `sql` | `dialect`, `database` | yes |
| `sumo` | `range` | yes |
| `cw` | `log_groups` (list), `range`, `region` | yes |
| `cmd` | `shell` (`sh` default, `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`), `cwd` | yes |
| `prompt` | — | yes |
| `link` | `url` (required, `http` or `https`) | no |
| `code` | `code:` with `repo` (`owner/name` or a git URL), `path`, `line`, `ref`, optional `symbol` and `end_line` | no |

Other keys are kept as they are and reported as info. kb accepts plain YAML: no anchors,
aliases, explicit tags or duplicate keys.

### Body

For `sql`, `sumo`, `cw`, `cmd` and `prompt`, the **payload** is the first fenced code block in the
body. Use a longer fence (four backticks, or tildes) to put code blocks inside a prompt. Everything
else in the body is **notes**. For `link` and `code`, the whole body is notes, and it may be empty.

### Variables

```yaml
vars:
  env:     { kind: enum, options: [prod, stage, dev], default: prod }
  minutes: { kind: number, default: 15, description: Look-back window }
  user:    { kind: text }
  token:   { kind: secret, env: API_TOKEN }
```

- `kind` is `text`, `number`, `enum` or `secret`. `enum` needs `options`.
- Reference a variable as `{{name}}` (lowercase letters, digits and `_`) in the payload or in
  `range`, `url`, `cwd` and `log_groups`.
- Write `\{{` for a literal `{{`.
- A reference that isn't declared is treated as `text` with no default.

### Secrets

Entries must never hold credentials. Use a `secret` variable that reads `env` (or is prompted for),
and never give it a `default`. `kb lint` rejects AWS keys, bearer tokens, JWTs, private keys and
high-entropy values assigned to names like `password` or `token`. If a line only looks like a
secret, end it with `kb:allow-secret` (in whatever comment syntax the payload uses); every
suppression is listed in the lint output.

## `kb lint`

```sh
kb lint                     # check the whole KB
kb lint sumo/ cmd/x.md      # check some directories or files
kb lint --strict            # warnings fail too
kb lint --quiet             # summary line only
```

Paths are tried relative to the current directory first, then relative to the KB root. Output
lists each finding with its file, line, column, rule code and a suggested fix, then a summary:

```text
sumo/bad.md:3:7: error[KB001-unknown-type]: unknown type "sumologic"; expected one of sql, sumo, cw, cmd, prompt, link, code
  fix: use "sumo"

284 entries, 1 error, 0 warnings
```

Exit codes: `0` no errors (and no warnings with `--strict`), `1` findings failed the run, `2` usage
or I/O error, such as a missing KB root. Every rule code is listed in
[`specs/001-entry-format/contracts/lint-rules.md`](specs/001-entry-format/contracts/lint-rules.md).

## Searching

```sh
kb search 5xx auth                    # every word must match, in any field
kb search latency type:cw tag:prod    # filters narrow the results
kb search '"role cache"'              # exact phrase (quote it for the shell too)
kb search auth --ids | fzf            # only IDs, one per line
kb search auth --json                 # ranges and snippets, for scripts and the TUI
kb search                             # everything, most used first
```

| Syntax | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `word` | Matches as a word prefix (`auth` finds `authorizer`), ignoring case and accents. Words of 5+ characters also match one typo (`authroizer`), ranked below exact matches. |
| `"two words"` | Exact phrase. |
| `type:cw` | Entry type; repeat for "any of". Same as `--type cw`. |
| `tag:prod` / `-tag:stage` | Has / lacks a tag; several `tag:` must all be present. Same as `--tag`, `--not-tag`. |
| `var:region` | Uses the variable `region`. |
| `repo:acme/api` | A `code` entry in that repo. |
| `in:title`, `in:payload`, `in:notes` | Restrict the free text to one field. |

Results are ordered by relevance (title, then tags, ID, variables and type-specific fields, payload,
notes), with entries you use often and recently ranked a little higher; an exact title match always
comes first. `--limit N` caps the results (default 20, `0` for all). Exit codes: `0` results, `1`
none (`kb: no matches` on stderr), `2` error. Entries with lint errors are left out, and each search
says how many (`run kb lint`).

The index lives in `.kb/index.db` and is brought up to date on every search: edit, rename or delete
a file and the next search sees it, with no command to run. It is disposable: delete `.kb/` any time
and it is rebuilt (you only lose usage counts in `.kb/state.json`). `kb index status` shows what is
indexed, and `kb reindex` rebuilds it from scratch. Both are git-ignored through `.kb/.gitignore`,
which kb creates whenever it creates `.kb/`.

## JSON output

Every command takes `--json` and prints a single JSON document, so kb composes with `jq`, `fzf` and
scripts:

```sh
kb lint --json | jq -r '.findings[] | select(.severity == "error") | "\(.path):\(.line) \(.code)"'
kb lint --json | jq '.summary'
kb init ~/kb --json | jq '.created'
kb search auth --json | jq -r '.results[] | "\(.id)\t\(.title)"'
```

The formats are defined in
[`lint-report.schema.json`](specs/001-entry-format/contracts/lint-report.schema.json) and
[`init-report.schema.json`](specs/001-entry-format/contracts/init-report.schema.json), and for
search by
[`search-report.schema.json`](specs/002-index-search/contracts/search-report.schema.json) and
[`index-status.schema.json`](specs/002-index-search/contracts/index-status.schema.json). On a usage or
I/O error (exit code `2`), `--json` prints `{"error": {"kind": "...", "message": "..."}}`.

kb never changes an entry while reading it: parsing then writing an unmodified file reproduces it
byte for byte, including comments, quoting and line endings.
